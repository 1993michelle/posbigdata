   Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It can run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory or 10x faster on disk. Apache Spark was created at AMPLabs in UC Berkeley as part of Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS). Apache Spark has an advanced DAG execution engine that supports acyclic data flow and in-memory computing. Also this, you can write applications and use it interactively quickly in Scala, Python, R shells.
   Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming. You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.

You can run Spark using its standalone cluster mode, on EC2, on Hadoop YARN, or on Apache Mesos. Access data in HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, Hive, Tachyon, and any Hadoop data source.

### How Apache Spark works
Apache Spark engine execute your  data processing in a distributed memory over a cluster of machines.
